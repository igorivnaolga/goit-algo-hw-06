# Task 1

Create a graph using the NetworkX library to model a real-world network (for example, a city’s transportation network, a social network, or internet topology).

ℹ️ You can choose any real-world network of your interest. If you can’t come up with one, feel free to model a simplified version that reflects a real-world scenario.

Visualize the created graph and analyze its key characteristics (for example, the number of nodes and edges, and the degree of nodes).

# Task 2

Write a program that uses the DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithms to find paths in the graph developed in Task 1.

Then, compare the results of both algorithms for this graph, highlight the differences in the obtained paths, and explain why the paths differ between the algorithms.

# Task 3

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in your developed graph:
Add weights to the edges and determine the shortest path between all the nodes in the graph.
